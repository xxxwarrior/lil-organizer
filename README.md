# lil-organizer

This is a small program to create notes, todos and set the reminders via terminal.
Created to play around with classes and some libraries (like os, re, datetime, colorama, plyer and others) and â˜º just for fun.

~~*Although it's not very useful in real life,*~~ you can:

- create txt notes, read and find them
- set not really useful but really funny reminders
- create todo lists (also txt)

ðŸŒˆThe menu is colorfulðŸŒˆ
